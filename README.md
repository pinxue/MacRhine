Oh, those good old days! This is my first Mac OS X program, I was interesting in hackintosh and my PC happen to have this NIC and there was no driver working.

I forgot to pay the domain fee for pinxue.net and it was registered immediately by some domain business guy, I guess it was because the pronounce of pinxue is same for anemia, anyway, the website just disappeared. And I got a bit busy (lazy) to get the website back lately ^_-. If you are interested for the original page, try the waybackmachine here https://web.archive.org/web/20081219094455/http://www.pinxue.net/mac/viarhine.html

I run into some discussion about network implementation for microkernel OS recently, this project is recalled immediately, the macOS network design is so elegant and impressive.
